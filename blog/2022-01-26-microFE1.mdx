- 这是我对于MFE比较系统学习记录的首篇blog 
- 主要参考的Cam Jackson的文章[Micro Frontends](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)
:::

Cam Jackson 是Thoughtworks的全栈工程师，这篇文章虽然出自2019年，但是对于MFE概念的初学者还是友好的，可以比较容易的理解。
相应的文章最后还提供了MEF的example, 按照文章顺序去学习，应该可以很快入门。我的这篇blog，算是对他的文章和我一点经验的总结，
我们直接步入正题。

<!--truncate-->

## 1. Micro Frontends

"An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole"

这是Cam Jackson 或者说是Thoughtworks对MFE的定义。我们从中可以提取到两个重点：
- independently deliverable. 独立交付
- composed into a greater whole. 组合构成整体

### 1-1. MFE cost 

因为后面我们要详细解读下MFE的Benefits，所以这里主要是先将一下他的cost：

:::note
there are no free lunches when it comes to software architecture - everything comes with a cost.

- Some micro frontend implementations can lead to duplication of dependencies
- increasing the number of bytes our users must download
- the dramatic increase in team autonomy can cause fragmentation in the way your teams work

Nonetheless, we believe that these risks can be managed, and that the benefits of micro frontends often outweigh the costs
:::

总体来说，MFE可能会导致依赖重复，增加了需要download的asset，还有就是独立团队工作方式上的一些挑战。对于结论Thoughtworks认为总体上MFE还是利大于弊的。
我们接下来说说Benefits。


## 2. Benefits

### 2-1. Incremental upgrades(增量升级)

The endgame here is that we're afforded more freedom to make case-by-case decisions on individual parts of our product, 
and to make incremental upgrades to our architecture, our dependencies, and our user experience. 
If there is a major breaking change in our main framework, each micro frontend can be upgraded whenever it makes sense, 
rather than being forced to stop the world and upgrade everything at once. If we want to experiment with new technology, 
or new modes of interaction, we can do it in a more isolated fashion than we could before.

好处之一就是MFE的子模块升级是自主的，并且与主模块解耦，即主模块有过有些大的major breaking changes，子模块也不需要和主模块同步进行修改和升级。
而是可以选择一个自身合适的时机来进行升级。

:::tip
这里面我的理解是：主模块的以来还是会default影响MFE的子模块的，但是子模块自身可以选择要不要这种影响，即依赖主模块的依赖，
或者关闭主模块依赖而只选择自身的依赖，这样就比较灵活和自主了。这条我会在后面进行相应的印证。

### 2-2. Simple, decoupled codebases(简单，解耦)

These smaller codebases tend to be simpler and easier for developers to work with. 
In particular, we avoid the complexity arising from unintentional and inappropriate coupling between components 
that should not know about each other. 

micro frontends push you to be explicit and deliberate about how data and events flow 
between different parts of the application, which is something that we should have been doing anyway!

MFE一定是小而精的，尽量减少组件间数据或事件传输，这一点需要我们深入的思考。


### 2-3. Independent deployment(独立部署)

Just as with microservices, independent deployability of micro frontends is key. 
This reduces the scope of any given deployment, which in turn reduces the associated risk. 
Regardless of how or where your frontend code is hosted, each micro frontend should have 
its own continuous delivery pipeline, which builds, tests and deploys it all the way to production. 
We should be able to deploy each micro frontend with very little thought given to the current state of 
other codebases or pipelines. It shouldn't matter if the old monolith is on a fixed, manual, 
quarterly release cycle, or if the team next door has pushed a half-finished or broken feature into their master branch. 
If a given micro frontend is ready to go to production, it should be able to do so, and that decision 
should be up to the team who build and maintain it.

MFE是需要对立进行build，test和deploy到production的，这个也是其主要特征之一，也是一般项目进行MFE架构重构的主要目的。

### 2-4. Autonomous teams(自治团队)

Teams can have full ownership of everything they need to deliver value to customers, 
which enables them to move quickly and effectively

依赖越少，响应越灵活。这个和第三条比较相辅相成。

## 3. Integration approaches

:::note
 there is a micro frontend for each page in the application, and there is a single container application, which:
- renders common page elements such as headers and footers
- addresses cross-cutting concerns like authentication and navigation
- brings the various micro frontends together onto the page, and tells each micro frontend when and where to render itself
:::

<img src="/metaTrip/build/img/blog/composition.png" alt="" style={{width: '100%'}}/>


### 3-1. Server-side template composition

rendering HTML on the server out of multiple templates or fragments. 
We have an index.html which contains any common page elements, 
and then uses server-side includes to plug in page-specific content from fragment HTML files

```jsx
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Feed me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>🍽 Feed me</h1>
    <!--# include file="$PAGE.html" -->
  </body>
</html>
```

```jsx
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name localhost;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
    ssi on;

    # Redirect / to /browse
    rewrite ^/$ http://localhost:8080/browse redirect;

    # Decide which HTML fragment to insert based on the URL
    location /browse {
      set $PAGE 'browse';
    }
    location /order {
      set $PAGE 'order';
    }
    location /profile {
      set $PAGE 'profile'
    }

    # All locations should render through index.html
    error_page 404 /index.html;
}
```

This example shows how micro frontends is not necessarily a new technique, 
and does not have to be complicated. 
As long as we're careful about how our design decisions affect the autonomy of our codebases and our teams, we can achieve many of the same benefits regardless of our tech stack.

实际上这个例子只是要告诉我们，MFE是一种思想，并不是一个新的技术，或者需要新的技术才可以实现。
只要满足独立交付，组合构成整体都应该是MFE的范畴。


### 3-2. Build-time integration

One approach that we sometimes see is to publish each micro frontend as a package, 
and have the container application include them all as library dependencies. 
Here is how the container's package.json might look for our example app:

```jsx
{
  "name": "@feed-me/container",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A food delivery web app",
  "dependencies": {
    "@feed-me/browse-restaurants": "^1.2.3",
    "@feed-me/order-food": "^4.5.6",
    "@feed-me/user-profile": "^7.8.9"
  }
}
```

component ui library 框架就是一种build-time的模式。他的引用是基于package的，依赖的形式存在。
很多大的项目也是这种假的MFE开发方式。

At first this seems to make sense. It produces a single deployable Javascript bundle, 
as is usual, allowing us to de-duplicate common dependencies from our various applications. 
However, this approach means that we have to re-compile and release every single micro frontend 
in order to release a change to any individual part of the product. Just as with microservices, 
we've seen enough pain caused by such a lockstep release process that we would recommend 
strongly against this kind of approach to micro frontends.

这种方式的不合理之处就在于compile和release都需要同步进行，这个和MFE独立交付的概念是绝对相反的，是反MFE的一种方式。
We should find a way to integrate our micro frontends at run-time, rather than at build-time.


### 3-3. Run-time integration via iframes

One of the simplest approaches to composing applications together in the browser is the humble iframe. 
By their nature, iframes make it easy to build a page out of independent sub-pages. 
They also offer a good degree of isolation in terms of styling and global variables not interfering with each other.

```jsx
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Feed me!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Feed me!</h1>

    <iframe id="micro-frontend-container"></iframe>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      const microFrontendsByRoute = {
        '/': 'https://browse.example.com/index.html',
        '/order-food': 'https://order.example.com/index.html',
        '/user-profile': 'https://profile.example.com/index.html',
      };

      const iframe = document.getElementById('micro-frontend-container');
      iframe.src = microFrontendsByRoute[window.location.pathname];
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

It can be difficult to build integrations between different parts of the application, 
so they make routing, history, and deep-linking more complicated, 
and they present some extra challenges to making your page fully responsive.

iframes觉得是MFE最简单的实现方式，我们主要考虑到灵活性的一些问题而不去采用它。比如responsive的实现就很困难。


### 3-4. Run-time integration via JavaScript(主要实现方式)

probably the most flexible one, and the one that we see teams adopting most frequently. 
Each micro frontend is included onto the page using a **script** tag, and upon load exposes a global function as its entry-point. 
The container application then determines which micro frontend should be mounted, 
and calls the relevant function to tell a micro frontend when and where to render itself.

```jsx
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Feed me!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Feed me!</h1>

    <!-- These scripts don't render anything immediately -->
    <!-- Instead they attach entry-point functions to `window` -->
    <script src="https://browse.example.com/bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="https://order.example.com/bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="https://profile.example.com/bundle.js"></script>

    <div id="micro-frontend-root"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // These global functions are attached to window by the above scripts
      const microFrontendsByRoute = {
        '/': window.renderBrowseRestaurants,
        '/order-food': window.renderOrderFood,
        '/user-profile': window.renderUserProfile,
      };
      const renderFunction = microFrontendsByRoute[window.location.pathname];

      // Having determined the entry-point function, we now call it,
      // giving it the ID of the element where it should render itself
      renderFunction('micro-frontend-root');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The above is obviously a primitive example, but it demonstrates the basic technique. 
Unlike with build-time integration, we can deploy each of the bundle.js files independently.
And unlike with iframes, we have full flexibility to build integrations between our micro frontends however we like. 
We could extend the above code in many ways, for example to only download each JavaScript bundle as needed, 
or to pass data in and out when rendering a micro frontend.The flexibility of this approach, combined with the independent 
deployability, makes it our default choice, and the one that we've seen in the wild most often.

这种方式与iframe相比，可以解决子模块间的同步协作问题，比如responsive。与build-time相比，可以独立交付。而且还可以按需加载。
所以成为了MFE实现的最主要方式。


### 3-5. Run-time integration via Web Components

 for each micro frontend to define an HTML custom element for the container to instantiate, 
 instead of defining a global function for the container to call.

 ```jsx
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Feed me!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Feed me!</h1>

    <!-- These scripts don't render anything immediately -->
    <!-- Instead they each define a custom element type -->
    <script src="https://browse.example.com/bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="https://order.example.com/bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="https://profile.example.com/bundle.js"></script>

    <div id="micro-frontend-root"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      // These element types are defined by the above scripts
      const webComponentsByRoute = {
        '/': 'micro-frontend-browse-restaurants',
        '/order-food': 'micro-frontend-order-food',
        '/user-profile': 'micro-frontend-user-profile',
      };
      const webComponentType = webComponentsByRoute[window.location.pathname];

      // Having determined the right web component custom element type,
      // we now create an instance of it and attach it to the document
      const root = document.getElementById('micro-frontend-root');
      const webComponent = document.createElement(webComponentType);
      root.appendChild(webComponent);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

the main difference being that you are opting in to doing things 'the web component way'. 
If you like the web component spec, and you like the idea of using capabilities that the browser provides, 
then this is a good option. If you prefer to define your own interface between the container 
application and micro frontends, then you might prefer the previous example instead.

如果不需要考虑IE浏览器，也是一个很好的选择。



## 4. Styling

In a micro frontends landscape, many of these problems are exacerbated. For example,
if one team's micro frontend has a stylesheet that says h2 { color: black; }, 
and another one says h2 { color: blue; }, and both these selectors are attached to the same page, 
then someone is going to be disappointed! This is not a new problem, 
but it's made worse by the fact that these selectors were written by different teams at different times, 
and the code is probably split across separate repositories, making it more difficult to discover.

:::tip
MFE主要是解决css的样式重名问题，目前的css有多种写法来避免这个问题， BEM，sass/less, css in js.
我目前对这个具体的解决方式还有待理解，后面我会去印证一下。
:::



## 5. Shared component libraries

We mentioned above that visual consistency across micro frontends is important, 
and one approach to this is to develop a library of shared, re-usable UI components. 
In general we believe that this a good idea, although it is difficult to do well. 
The main benefits of creating such a library are reduced effort through re-use of code, 
and visual consistency. In addition, your component library can serve as a living styleguide, 
and it can be a great point of collaboration between developers and designers.


简单来说，MFE也是需要同意视觉UI 标准的，这趋势就需要一个component ui 库来支持。比如mui，bootstrap。
或者是项目自建，自建的方式可以是从多个子模块中抽取common的组件。而不用day1的时候就构建。
但是这个component ui 库是需要的。 

:::tip
我需要在项目中进一步印证一下。比如BRP和New UI MFE的关系
:::


## 6. Cross-application communication

One of the most common questions regarding micro frontends is **how to let them talk to each other**. 
In general, we recommend having them communicate as little as possible, 
as it often reintroduces the sort of inappropriate coupling that we're seeking to avoid in the first place.

That said, some level of cross-app communication is often needed. 
- Custom events allow micro frontends to communicate indirectly, which is a good way to minimise direct coupling, 
though it does make it harder to determine and enforce the contract that exists between micro frontends. 
- Alternatively, the React model of passing callbacks and data downwards (in this case downwards from the container 
application to the micro frontends) is also a good solution that makes the contract more explicit. 
- A third alternative is to use the address bar as a communication mechanism.

Whatever approach we choose, we want our micro frontends to communicate by sending messages or events to each other, 
and avoid having any shared state. 

Just like sharing a database across microservices, as soon as we share our data structures and domain models, 
we create massive amounts of coupling, and it becomes extremely difficult to make changes.

这块我现在还理解不到位，需要进行一些POC，之后会另外详细写一篇blog。
